    "text": "1.1 Dendrograms (Tree Diagrams) and Evolution\nThis workshop introduces and reinforces concepts related to transmission and evolution of respiratory viruses.\nIn this workshop, you will produce dendrograms: these are tree diagrams that can represent the process of evolution. You have already seen tree diagrams, like those in Figure 1.1, used on this course to represent the process of evolution.\nTypically, in evolutionary analyses, you will see that these trees are organised to show a progression through time. The leaves of the tree usually represent things that exist “now” or, at least, most recently (these are at the right hand side of Figure 1.1).\nThe dendrogram traces lines - branches - from the leaves, and these gradually meet up together, just as branches of a real tree do, as you progress from right to left in Figure 1.1. Eventually, they all meet up together at the oldest (left-most, in Figure 1.1) part of the tree, (called the root).\nTrees like this can be used to represent large-scale evolution, like the complete Tree of Life in Figure 1.1, or evolution on a small scale. For example, Figure 1.2 represents evolution of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a UK hospital. This tree was used to trace the source of infection in a burns unit, ultimately locating the precise valve in the plumbing from which the infectious agent was finding its way into patients (Quick et al. (2014)).",

    "section": "1.2 Interpreting a tree",
    "text": "1.2 Interpreting a tree\nThe trees in Figure 1.1 and Figure 1.2 both imply a branching evolutionary process. A single common ancestor to every organism represented at one of the leaves existed at some point in history, and that date in history is on the very leftmost point of the tree. The rest of the tree is a representation of how evolution progressed from that single ancestor to the variety of organisms represented at the leaf nodes.\n\n1.2.1 Branch lengths\nAs you move from left-to-right in those trees, there is a short horizontal line (the root) that represents time passing for that ancestor. But then the branch splits into two (it diverges), representing some kind of event that produces distinct “offspring.” Each of these proceeds through time as a horizontal line for a distance before itself diverging to result in two new, differentiable offspring, and so on and so on until the leaf nodes are reached.\nThe lengths of the branches here represent, in some way, the passage of time between consecutive divergences (or a leaf node and the most recent split). The longer the branch, the longer the passage of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe length of a branch doesn’t necessarily correspond exactly to time\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, when we make these trees, we are usually measuring something other than time, itself. More often we are measuring some kind of difference between the leaf nodes, and assuming that a difference of 200 corresponds to 200 units of time (years, millennia, etc.), and a difference of 1000 corresponds to 1000 units.\nBiology is complicated, and this assumption rarely holds exactly. There are methods to try to turn our measurements accurately into units of time, but they are beyond the scope of this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Cladograms and Phylograms\nThere is more than one kind of dendrogram. Two types you will meet frequently are:\n\nphylograms: each branch length is intended to represent the passage of time (or some other measure of difference) - they represent change on an evolutionary timescale\ncladograms: all branch lengths are the same - they do not represent change on an evolutionary timescale, only the order of divergences in the tree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Phylogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Cladogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: The same evolutionary tree represented as a phylogram, and as a cladogram. In a phylogram the branch lengths may be uneven. They represent evolutionary time between nodes (divergences and/or leaves on the tree), and the time between those may vary. In a cladogram the branch lengths are identical and the tree only represents topology - the order in which branches diverge.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Topology\nTopology is the order of branching in a tree: the order of divergence events from the common ancestor of all leaf nodes to the present. Two trees with the same order of branching, but different branch lengths, have the same topology, and imply the same sequence of divergences.\nFor example, in Figure 1.3 the first divergence separates Mouse from all the other mammals, and then the next divergence separates Bovine from the primates. Whether you examine the phylogram or the cladogram, the order of branching - the topology - of the tree is the same. They represent the same evolutionary sequence of events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEven if two trees share the same topology, and the same sequence of events, if any branch lengths differ the trees might still represent different evolutionary histories as the times between those events may differ.\n\n\nTwo trees can look superficially different, but actually represent the same sequence of branching events, and even the same evolutionary history, as is the case in Figure 1.4. Here, the tree has been rotated around the node that joins Human to Chimp. Although Human is above Chimp in one tree and below it in the other, both trees have identical topology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original tree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Tree with rotation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: In any tree, branches can be rotated around an internal node without changing the structure or interpretation of the tree. Here, the two leaf nodes highlighted in purple (Figure 1.4 (a)) are rotated around their common ancestor to give the tree in Figure 1.4 (b). The rotated conformation is highlighted in green. Even though the two trees look different, the evolutionary relationships they represent are identical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nIs the tree represented in Figure 1.4 equivalent to the tree shown in Figure 1.3 (a)?",

    "section": "1.3 Evolution and Clustering",
    "text": "1.3 Evolution and Clustering\nThe examples in Figure 1.1, Figure 1.2, and Figure 1.4 are representations of evolution. In all cases, two organisms that share a more recent common ancestor (like Chimp and Human in Figure 1.4) combine together at a closer node than do two more distantly-related organisms (like Chimp and Gibbon).\nIt is natural to think of this representation as the divergence of species, as Gibbon diverging from ancestral primates at an earlier stage than Gorilla diverging from the ancestor of Chimp and Human. But it is also a representation of clustering. What this means is that we cluster Chimp more closely with Human than with Bovine because Chimp and Human share more similarities with each other than either do with Bovine.\nIn practice this means we can use mathematical approaches that cluster similar things together into trees to approximate evolutionary history, so long as what we use to measure similarity is relevant to evolution. Methods that perform this kind of clustering to produce a tree are called hierarchical clustering methods and you will use one of these to infer an evolutionary history for the `flu viruses you are evolving in the workshop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo different ways to reconstruct evolution\n\n\n\n\n\nHierarchical clustering methods are only one way to build an evolutionary tree. They were the first to be used, because they are not difficult to understand, and are relatively straightforward and quick to calculate. All of these methods apply an algorithm to construct a tree (or hierarchy - hence “hierarchical”) from a matrix (table) of distances between organisms. Methods that use this approach include Neighbour-Joining (Gascuel and Steel (2006)), and UPGMA. For these methods to produce an evolutionary tree, the distance we measure between organisms should reflect their evolutionary separation.\nThe development of cheap, powerful computing enabled more advanced and more accurate mathematical methods of evolutionary reconstruction to be used routinely. Such methods include Maximum Likelihood (ML, Xia (2018)) and Bayesian (Nascimento, Reis, and Yang (2017)) approaches. These methods require significant computing power and differ from hierarchical clustering because they attempt to fit statistically a model of evolution (like fitting a curve on a graph) to the data obtained from each organism, rather than using an algorithm to build a tree from distances.\nIn modern biology, a standard laptop can very quickly produce trees using Maximum Likelihood methods that fit an explicit and well-justified model of evolution. As a result algorithmic methods, such as Neighbour-Joining and UPGMA, which are prone to systematic errors and inaccuracies, and whose only real advantage was speed, are no longer considered good practice for evolutionary reconstruction.\nIf you’re interested in learning more about how we do this in practice, you might be interested in this course, by Dr Conor Meehan:\n\nIntroduction to Phylogenetics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s build a tree\n\n\n\nLet’s get started with building a UPGMA tree by clicking on the link UPGMA (here, in the menu, or below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGascuel, Olivier, and Mike Steel. 2006. “Neighbor-Joining Revealed.” Mol.

This is true in the same way that it’s not obvious how to measure a distance between a cat and a dog, or a human and a whale, or a bacterium and a fungus.\nOne approach to defining distances, developed as part of an approach to reconstructing evolution called cladistics, is to define characters that the chocolate types either possess or do not possess. For example, a Mars Bar contains caramel, but a Bounty does not. A Dairy Milk bar is flat, but Smarties are not.\nBy defining a set of characters, we can make a table of properties that might be shared, or not, between all our chocolate bars: Table 2.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Characters assigned to varieties of chocolate: 1 indicates character presence, 0 indicates its absence.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Chocolate Bar \n    Drops? \n    Bar? \n    Candy shell \n    Chocolate \n    Peanut \n    Coconut \n    More than one element \n    Caramel \n    Wafer \n    Biscuit \n    Raisins \n    Honeycomb \n    Flat? \n    Nougat \n    Marshmallow \n  \n \n\n  \n    Smarties \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Mars \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Crunchie \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Maltesers \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Tunnock's Tea Cake \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut these aren’t themselves distances, so how can we get a distance from this kind of data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHamming Distance\n\n\n\nOne way we can calculate distances between rows of character tables like Table 2.1 is by using the Hamming distance. Here’s an example.\nSuppose you have a table with two rows that look like Table 2.2\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: A pair of objects with characters that are either present (1) or absent (0).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    group \n    hyphae \n    chitin \n    cellulose \n    spores \n    legs \n  \n \n\n  \n    fungi \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    oomycete \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can look along the rows and count up the number of columns that differ. hyphae, spores, and legs character values are the same for both fungi and oomycetes. But they differ in chitin and cellulose - two characters. So the Hamming Distance between fungi and oomycetes here is \\(H = 2\\).\nWe can calculate similar Hamming distances for each pair of chocolotes in Table 2.1, to produce the distance matrix in Table 2.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Hamming distance matrix generated from the chocolate characters.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    ...1 \n    Smarties \n    Mars \n    Crunchie \n    Maltesers \n    Tunnock's Tea Cake \n  \n \n\n  \n    Smarties \n    0 \n    6 \n    5 \n    2 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Mars \n    6 \n    0 \n    3 \n    6 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Crunchie \n    5 \n    3 \n    0 \n    3 \n    4 \n  \n  \n    Maltesers \n    2 \n    6 \n    3 \n    0 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Tunnock's Tea Cake \n    5 \n    5 \n    4 \n    5 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Applying UPGMA\n\nAs with the example in the drop-down box above, we start by identifying the most similar chocolates. Here, that is Maltesers and Smarties, with a distance of \\(H=2\\). We combine these into the group (Smarties, Maltesers), and note they have a branch length to their common ancestor of \\(\\frac{2}{2} = 1\\).\nNow we update the distance matrix. We need to calculate the arithmetic mean of the distances from Smarties and Maltesers to each other variety of chocolate. These distances are given in Table 2.4:\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.4: Calculating distance from (Smarties, Maltesers) to the other chocolates.\n\n\n\n\n\nChocolate\nH(Smarties)\nH(Maltesers)\nH((Smarties, Maltesers))\n\n\n\n\nMars\n6\n6\n\\(\\frac{6 + 6}{2} = 6\\)\n\n\nCrunchie\n5\n3\n\\(\\frac{5 + 3}{2} = 4\\)\n\n\nTunnocks\n5\n5\n\\(\\frac{5 + 5}{2} = 5\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOnce we start taking averages, the distances are no longer Hamming distances, technically. But we’ll carry on using the \\(H(object1, object2)\\) form, for convenience.\n\n\n\nNext we take out the individual Smarties and Maltesers rows and columns from the distance matrix, and replace them with a new row and column that reflects the combined (Smarties, Maltesers) ancestor distances from Table 2.4:\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.5: Distance matrix generated from the chocolate characters.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    ...1 \n    (Smarties, Maltesers) \n    (Mars, Crunchie) \n    Tunnock's Tea Cake \n  \n \n\n  \n    (Smarties, Maltesers) \n    0 \n    6 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    (Mars, Crunchie) \n    6 \n    0 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Tunnock's Tea Cake \n    5 \n    5 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the most closely-related pair of chocolates in Table 2.5 is Mars and Crunchie, with distance \\(H=3\\), so they have a branch length to their common ancestor of \\(\\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\\).\nWe update the distance matrix again. We calculate the arithmetic mean of the distances from Mars and Crunchie to the other chocolates:\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.6: Calculating distance from (Mars, Crunchie) to the remaining chocolates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChocolate\nH(Mars)\nH(Crunchie)\nH((Mars, Crunchie))\n\n\n\n\n(Smarties, Maltesers)\n6\n4\n\\(\\frac{6 + 4}{2} = 5\\)\n\n\nTunnocks\n5\n4\n\\(\\frac{5 + 4}{2} = 4.5\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd once more we update the distance matrix to reflect the newly-calculated values for (Mars, Crunchie) in Table 2.6:\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.7: Distance matrix generated from the chocolate characters.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    ...1 \n    (Smarties, Maltesers) \n    (Mars, Crunchie) \n    Tunnock's Tea Cake \n  \n \n\n  \n    (Smarties, Maltesers) \n    0 \n    6 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    (Mars, Crunchie) \n    6 \n    0 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Tunnock's Tea Cake \n    5 \n    5 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the most similar pair of chocolates in Table 2.7 is (Mars, Crunchie) and Tunnock’s, with a distance of 5 (so a branch length to their common ancestor of $ = 2.5). They come together to make the new group ((Mars, Crunchie), Tunnock’s)\nOnce more we update the distance matrix We calculate the arithmetic mean of the distances from (Mars, Crunchie) and Tunnock’s to (Smarties, Maltesers):\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.8: Calculating distance from ((Mars, Crunchie), Tunnock’s) to (Smarties, Maltesers).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChocolate\nH((Mars, Crunchie))\nH(Tunnock’s)\nH(((Mars, Crunchie), Tunnock’s))\n\n\n\n\n(Smarties, Maltesers)\n6\n5\n\\(\\frac{6 + 5}{2} = 5.5\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we update the distance matrix to reflect the newly-calculated values for (Mars, Crunchie) in Table 2.8:\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.9: Distance matrix generated from the chocolate characters.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    ...1 \n    (Smarties, Maltesers) \n    ((Mars, Crunchie), Tunnock's) \n  \n \n\n  \n    (Smarties, Maltesers) \n    0.0 \n    5.5 \n  \n  \n    ((Mars, Crunchie), Tunnock's) \n    5.5 \n    0.0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last step now is to note that ((Mars, Crunchie), Tunnock’s) connects to (Smarties, Maltesers) at a distance of 5.5, so the branch length to each from their common ancestor is \\(\\frac{5.5}{2} = 2.75\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: UPGMA tree, including branch lengths, for the five chocolate varieties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the tree\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3 shows what we might have guessed from the distance matrix.\n\nSmarties and Maltesers are more similar to each other than they are to the other chocolates. This makes sense as both are packets of small elements, not bars.\nThe Mars and Crunchie bars, being bar-shaped and wrapped in chocolate, are more similar to each other than they are to any of the other chocolates, which are not bars.\nThe Tunnock’s Tea Cake is unlike all the other chocolates (it is the deepest-branching chocolate), and probably groups with the Mars Bar and Crunchie because you only get one in a wrapper. If there were two in a packet, or it was a box of teacakes, the tree might have looked different.",
